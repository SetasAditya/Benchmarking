    # You may need to implement other methods required by the base class based on your specific requirements

# Example usage:
# Create an instance of the Levy environment
dimension = 1  # Dimension of the problem (e.g., number of variables)
env = LevyEnvironment(dimension)

# Now you can use this environment with the TrustRegionAgent for Levy function minimization
